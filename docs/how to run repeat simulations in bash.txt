first: 	specify number of repetitions to add to simulation in the omnetpp.ini file:
		repeat=10

then, in the bash cmd line, run:
opp_makemake -f											<-- generate Makefile
make													<-- generate executable with number of repetitions specified
opp_runall ./omnetpp_network_simulation.exe -r 0..9		<-- run all simulations 0 through 9 in a row,
															final sim number must be one less than repetitions specified
															in the omnetpp.ini due to zero indexing
															

Note: to run all repetitions nonstop automatically without GUI, 
simply add the option: "-f Cmdenv" to the end of the opp_runall call
